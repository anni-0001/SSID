# SSID-Docker

This project is an improvement of previous works on Stepping Stone Intrusion Detection (SSID). Automation is the focus to mantain flexibilty as well as seemless experiment integrity for each round of samples. Using Docker, this project simulates network activity as if there were stepping stone attacks occuring, all while collecting network traffic samples. 

This project can create an unlimited size data set on SSID to be using for machine learning applications.

# Documentation

## Running

requirements:
* docker daemon running
* venv environment set up with scapy installed
* change value in /SSH_MODEL/.env to YOUR repo dir

terminal:
$ cd SSH_MODEL  
$ chmod 700 docker-external.sh  
$ sudo ./docker-external.sh  
** enter prompt values**
program takes care of everything else!

## Triggering Structure
(1) docker-external.sh -->   
(2) compose-bash.sh & ssh-config.sh -->  
(3) docker-compose.yml -->  
(4) docker-internal.sh -->  
(5) tmux.sh  
--> = triggers script  


## Files & Uses
docker-external.sh : 
* takes user input for devices, rounds, and scan time
* Manages experiment loop and docker container management
* sets values in round.txt, dev-num.txt, scan_time.txt and proxy.txt

compose-bash.sh : 
* generates a dynamic docker-compose.yml based on configured options for each experiment

ssh-config.sh
* generates dynamic ssh config file for each docker container for each experiment

docker-internal.sh
* manages the internal commands within docker containers
* sets up scans using tcpdump, first device always attacker container



## Available Models

- SSH Tunnel: SSH_MODEL
    * purely SSH tunnel
- TCP SSH Tunnel: TCP_SSH_MODEL
    * SSH tunnel with TCP chain at random interval between hosts

Future:
    - HTTP Tunnel (netcat/socat)
    - FTP Tunnel


# Management Commands

To see currently running containers:
docker ps

To see all containers:
docker ps -a

To enter any container within instance:
    docker exec -it <container ID> bash

To rebuild all instances with updated Dockerfile: 
    docker-compose up --build

To stop docker containers:
docker stop <container ID>

To remove docker containers:
docker rm <container ID>
